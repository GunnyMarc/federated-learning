# Federated Learning: Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning

A comprehensive implementation of Federated Learning algorithms in PyTorch, demonstrating how to train machine learning models across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy.

## 📚 Overview

This repository implements federated learning from scratch, showcasing how to:
- Train models without centralizing sensitive data

- Implement FedSGD and FedAvg algorithms
- Compare federated learning with traditional centralized training

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Complete Implementation**: Full federated learning pipeline in PyTorch
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Both FedSGD and FedAvg implementations
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Handles IID and Non-IID data distributions
- **Client Selection**: Random client sampling for realistic scenarios
- **Performance Comparison**: Benchmarks against traditional training
- **Educational**: Extensively commented code for learning

## 🧪 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD)

FedSGD treats each client as a mini-batch and aggregates gradients:

```python
# Compute gradients on client data
gradients = compute_gradients(client_data, model_weights)

# Aggregate on server
global_weights = aggregate_gradients(all_gradients)
```

### 2. Federated Averaging (FedAvg)

FedAvg allows multiple local epochs and aggregates model weights:

```python
# Train locally for E epochs
for epoch in range(E):
    local_weights = train_local_model(client_data)

# Aggregate weights on server
global_weights = weighted_average(all_client_weights)
```

## 📊 Key Concepts

### When to Use Federated Learning

Federated learning is ideal when:

1. **Proxy data is not suitable**: Real device data differs significantly from public datasets
2. **Data is privacy-sensitive**: Contains personal information (photos, texts, health data)
3. **Data is naturally labeled**: User interactions provide implicit labels

### Challenges Addressed

- **Privacy Concerns**: Data never leaves user devices
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Only model updates are transmitted
- **Non-IID Data**: Techniques to handle heterogeneous data distributions
- **Client Selection**: Strategies for selecting active clients per round

## 📈 Performance Comparisons

### IID vs Non-IID Data

| Scenario | Round 6 Accuracy |
|----------|------------------|
| Traditional Training | ~52.6% |
| Federated (IID) | ~51.6% |
| Federated (Non-IID) | ~31.4% |
| Federated (Non-IID + Fine-tuning) | ~41.2% |

*Note: These are illustrative results from simplified models*

## 🔬 Advanced Features

### Client Selection Strategies

```python
# Random client selection
selected_clients = random_client_selection(
    num_clients=total_clients,
    fraction=0.3
)

# Availability-based selection
selected_clients = availability_based_selection(
    clients=all_clients,
    time_window='daytime'
)
```

### Handling Non-IID Data

```python
# Fine-tune on common dataset
def train_with_common_data(client_models, common_dataset):
    for model in client_models:
        fine_tune(model, common_dataset, epochs=1)
    return client_models
```

## 📖 Examples

### Example 1: Basic Federated Learning

```python
from src.federated_learning import FederatedLearning

# Create federated learning system
fl = FederatedLearning(num_clients=8)

# Train for 10 communication rounds
results = fl.train(num_rounds=10)

# Plot training progress
fl.plot_results(results)
```

### Example 2: Non-IID Data Handling

```python
# Create non-IID data distribution
fl = FederatedLearning(
    num_clients=8,
    data_type='non_iid',
    use_common_data=True
)

# Train with fine-tuning
results = fl.train(num_rounds=10, fine_tune=True)
```

See the `examples/` directory for more detailed use cases.
